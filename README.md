The detection of speed bumps is crucial for enhancing road safety and minimizing accidents. Accurate identification of speed bumps enables drivers to be alerted promptly, encouraging them to reduce speed and avoid potential vehicle damage or harm to pedestrians and other road users. However, manual detection of speed bumps can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Therefore, there is a growing interest in developing automated systems using computer vision techniques to detect speed bumps on roads in real-time.

The motivation behind developing automated speed bump detection systems stems from the need to improve road safety and mitigate the risks associated with speed bumps. Manual detection methods rely on human observation, which can be subjective and error-prone. By leveraging computer vision technologies, we can create more reliable and efficient systems that can detect speed bumps accurately and promptly, reducing the likelihood of accidents and enhancing overall road safety.

Several studies have explored the use of computer vision techniques for speed bump detection. For example, Shah and Deshmukh (2019) proposed a method for pothole and bump detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), demonstrating promising results in identifying road anomalies. Similarly, Saktheeswaran and Swan (2019) developed a real-time speed bump detection system using image segmentation techniques tailored for autonomous vehicles. Additionally, Varma et al. (2018) utilized deep learning and stereo camera technology for real-time detection of speed bumps and distance estimation. These studies highlight the potential of computer vision approaches in addressing the challenge of speed bump detection.

Despite the progress made in speed bump detection using computer vision, several open questions remain. One key question is how to achieve robust and accurate detection performance under diverse environmental conditions, such as varying lighting and weather conditions. Additionally, there is a need to explore the scalability of detection systems to handle large-scale road networks efficiently. Furthermore, integrating speed bump detection systems with existing infrastructure and vehicle technologies poses challenges in terms of compatibility and real-world deployment.

Our proposed approach involves leveraging deep learning models, such as Faster R-CNN, YOLOv5, and YOLOv4, for speed bump detection. We plan to augment the training data to improve classification accuracy and utilize tools like Roboflow for dataset labeling and management. The datasets will be prepared for training through data loading pipelines and resizing the images to standardized dimensions. By following this approach, we aim to develop a robust and efficient system for detecting speed bumps on roads, contributing to improved road safety and vehicle health monitoring.
